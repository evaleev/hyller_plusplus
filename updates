2006-11-13	Moller-Plesset code only lacks the exchange operator.

2006-10-16	Implemented crude Newton-Raphson optimizer. Introduced Clock to create timestamps
		which automate the process of recomputing.

2006-10-14	Introduced "inheritable" parameter sets. Defined the first parameterized
		basis set (GSHBasisSet), generic abstract optimizer,
		and outlined generic Newton-Raphson optimizer.

2006-10-13      New additions -- generic energy, hamiltonian, overlap classes.
		Started using boost::shared_ptr. Working toward generic
		parameter optimizer.

2006-10-13      Dyadya Sasha, I will always miss you.

2006-10-11	Implemented generic contracted basis functions and basis sets.

2006-10-01      Started generalized Slater Hylleraas code. Matrix elements will be computed using generic mechanism.

2006-09-30	Merged in general Hylleraas code (2 exponents) which I added in May.

2006-09-05	Started Slater-Hylleraas code.

2006-05-11	Initial C++ version. Very experimental at the moment. Can do 1S SCF. Need new integrals to compute MPn. CI part is commented out.
